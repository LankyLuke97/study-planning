0|2024-09-14|What are capital investments?|Capital investments are those investments in assets that are expected to provide economic benefit for longer than one year/business cycle.| |4.0| 
1|2024-09-25|How are capital investments recorded on financial statements?|Capital investments are recorded on the balance sheet as long-term assets less periodic amortisation/depreciation.| |4.0| 
2|2024-09-14|What are the four main categories of capital investments, along with why each type might be instigated?|The four main categories of capital investment are maintenance projects, which are generally necessary for the running of the company; projects to expand existing lines of business, generally initiated to take advantage of a likely opportunity; projects initiated by regulatory requirement; and projects looking to expand into new business lines or other.| |4.0| 
3|2024-09-18|For each type of capital investment, what are the levels of risk and return? What are some advantages and disadvantages?|Regulatory related investments are somewhat separate, being generally a legal requirement, but incumbents will attempt to use them to their advantage by ensuring they create barriers to entry in the market and leverage their political power to ensure they take place at the best time for them. Maintenance projects are the generally lowest risk and reward projects, simply undertaken to keep the business running or improve efficiencies - the costs are often well-known, and there are limited rewards in general. Expanding business lines comes with higher risk and often requires external funding, which comes with its own risks, but these come with commensurate higher returns. Expanding into entirely new business lines might be an almost entirely unknown endeavour with high risks and potentially high returns.| |4.0| 
4|2024-09-18|What are the four steps in the capital allocation process?|1. Idea generation, which is the process of coming up with ideas for investment projects.\n2. Investment analysis, where the company must decide whether to invest in a project, generally consisting of either net present value or internal rate of return calculations. \n3.Planning and prioritisation, where the project is considered in the broader context of all possible investments, where they may possibly be better allocations of capital available. \n4. Monitoring and post-investment review, where management will monitor the outcome, identify weaknesse or systematic biases in prokection processes, check that required rates of return are being met, etc.| |4.0| 
5|2024-09-21|What are the two methods for internal stakeholders to evaluate a potential capital allocation project?|A net present value calculation or an internal rate of return calculation.| |4.0| 
6|2024-09-14|What are the pros and cons of the methods for evaluating potential capital allocation projects, and when should they be used?| Net present value calculations discunt the cash flows at a more realistic rate of return which means the calculation is likely to be closer to the actual outcome.\nInternal rate of return looks similar, but doesn't work if there is more than one sign change in the cash flows, or if the interim cash flows aren't reinvested at the same rate (which can be quite unrealistic). For these reasons, NPV is preferred to IRR.| |4.0| 
7|2024-09-14|What method, equivalent to NPV or IRR questions for an internal analyst, would an external analyst use to evaluate a company's capital allocation?|Return on invested capital, or return on capital employed (ROIC/ROCE).| |4.0| 
8|2024-09-18|What are the pros and cons of ROIC or ROCE in relation to an external analyst evaluating a company's capital allocation?|It uses available information and shows how the company is investing money from both equity and debtholders. The aggregated nature also shows how the company is doing across all its projects, which is important for external investors who can't pick and choose where the money goes.\nHowever, it is an accounting rather than cash flow based measure, the two of which can often differ significantly; it is backward-looking and can be quite volatile as investments take years to make competitive returns; and it can hide profitable or unprofitable projects behind others.| |4.0| 
9|2024-09-25|What is goodwill?|Goodwill is the excess paid in comparison to the assets of a company when acquiring that company.| |4.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
10|2024-09-19|How is goodwill recorded on the financial statements?|It is capitalised on the balance sheet as intangible asset with indefinite life, less impairment for which it is tested annually.| |4.0| goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
11|2024-09-25|What are the generally accepted reasons for which goodwill is recorded?|There are three main reasons: certain items not listed on the balance sheet may have value (such as training provided to staff, brand identity, etc.); there may be partially completed projects which are not yet separably definable but are expected to have value; and there may be some expected economic benefit from improved strategic positioning, or perhaps operational savings.| |4.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
12|2024-09-14|What is a bargain purchase?|A bargain purchase is when the price paid to acquire a company is less than the fair value of the assets.| |4.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
13|2024-09-18|How is a bargain purchase recorded in the financial statements?|It is recorded immediately in the profit and loss of the year in which the purchase occurs.| |4.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
14|2024-09-25|What are the pros and cons of recording goodwill in the balance sheet?|Pros: Some analysts believe it does accurately reflect a real asset and therefore should be capitalised; others wish to use the information, along with future impairment information, to evaluate management's judgement. \nCons: Its assessment relies heavily on management's judgement and therefore is susceptible to all the usual pitfalls of human judgement, often leading to future write-offs.| |4.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
15|2024-09-21|How can analysts adjust for goodwill in the financial statements?|They can exclude goodwill from the balance sheet data; and they can exclude goodwill impairment losses from income data.| |4.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
16|2024-09-20|What is a financial instrument?|A contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or an equity of another entity - could be something like stock in a company or debt instruments.| |4.0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
17|2024-09-14|What is a derivative?|A financial contract whose value depends on some underlying value, such as a stock price or interest rates.| |4.0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
18|2024-09-15|How can financial instruments be measured on the financial statements subsequent to the intial investment?|Either at amortised cost or fair value, which can be through either other comprehesnsive income or through profit and loss. Measured at amortised cost are debt securities that are to be held to maturity, loans and notes receivable, and unquoted equity instruments. Measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income are 'available-for-sale' debt securities (US-GAAP) and debt securities for which the plan is to collect both interest cash flows and sell the asset (IFRS), as well as equity investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition (IFRS only). Measured at fair value through Profit and Loss are equity securities, 'trading' debt securities (US GAAP), securities not assigned to either of the two other categories, or investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition. Much of this applies to unrealised profit and loss - realised profits and losses upons sale of these assets is recorded as usual in profit and loss.| |3.0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
19|2024-09-14|What are non-current liabilities and what are two main categories?|Any liability not classified as current. Examples of categories include long-term financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.| |4.0|non-current liabilitiess,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
20|2024-09-18|What are deferred tax liabilities and how do they arise?|Deferred tax liabilities indicate a requirement to pay cash in the future to cover a tax obligation that has been reported as paid in accordance with accounting standards but has not yet been paid according to tax standards, It generally arises from expenses being declared earlier for taxes than for reporting purposes, which reduces taxable income in an earlier period, or for profits for a subsidiary which have not been distributed yet and therefore have not yet been taxed.| |4.0|non-current liabilitiess,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
21|2024-09-14|What is liquidity?|The ability of a company to meet its short-term obligations.| |4.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
22|2024-09-14|What is solvency?|The ability of a company to meet its long-term obligations, indicative of financial risk and financial leverage.| |4.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
23|2024-09-18|What is the current ratio?|Current assets / current liabilities| |4.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
24|2024-09-29|What is the quick ratio (acid test)?|(Cash + marketable securities + receivables) / current liabilities| |4.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
25|2024-09-29|What is the cash ratio?|(Cash + marketable securities) / current liabilities| |4.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
26|2024-09-19|What is the long-term debt-to-equity ratio?|Total long-term debt / total equity| |4.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
27|2024-09-14|What is the debt-to-equity ratio?|Total debt / total equity| |4.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
28|2024-09-18|What is the total debt ratio?|Total debt / total assets| |4.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
29|2024-09-20|What is the financial leverage ratio?|Total assets / total equity| |4.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
30|2024-09-19|What are the four primary financial statements, and what does each describe?|1. Balance sheet, which provides a point-in-time view of the financial position of an entity, covering assets and liabilities. \n2. Income statement, which is an accrual based flow statement showing operations in the period between two balance sheets. \n3. Statement of cash flows, a flow based statement showing movement of cash in and out of the company, split into operating cash flows, investment cash flows, and financing cash flows. \n4. Statement of shareholders' equity, a flow based statement showing the major compponents of shareholders' equity (primarily stock and retained earnings) and changes to that from one balance sheet to the next, such as further net income less dividends, or issuance of new stock.| |4.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
31|2024-09-25|How does the cash flow statement link two balance sheets?|Beginning cash +/- operating cash flow +/- investing cash flow +/- financing cash flow = ending cash| |4.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
32|2024-09-08|How do the cash flow statement and the income statement link together?|Financing cash flows are added/subtracted from operating income to give taxable income prior to net income (earnings before taxes). Net income is, after some adjustments, operating cash flow.| |0.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
33|2024-09-25|How does the statement of shareholders' equity link two balance sheets?|Beginning retained earnings + net income - dividends = ending retained earnings| |4.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
34|2024-09-21|How do the statement of cash flows and income statement link to current assets and liabilities?|Differences in timings between recognition of taxes, expenses, and revenue on the income statement versus actual movement of cash give rise to various short-term assets and liabilites. For example, revenue recognised ithout an accompanying cash flow would increase the Accounts Receivable asset account, which would later be decreased by an incoming operating cash flow; if the opposite were to happen, a liability of deferred revenue would be created, later to be derecognised when the revenue is recognised' expenses paid in cash in advance of recognition would be a decrease to Accounts Payable or another accrued liability account.| |4.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
35|2024-09-20|What are the two methods of calculating oerating cash flows and how does each work?|The two methods are the direct method and the indirect method. The direct method is offsetting gross cash receipts with cash payments. Although this is eminently manageable with automation software these days, many company's will go via the indirecthod, which is via reconciling net income to net cash flows. Analysts may well want to convert the indirect to the direct method.| |4.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
36|2024-09-20|How does an analyst estimate operating cash flows using the direct method without access to the underlying receipts and payments information?| They can use the balance sheet and income statement information to estimate the major categories of cash receipts and payments. First, they work out cash received from customers by taking revenue and subtract/add any increase/decrease in accounts receivable between the two balance sheets. They would also subtract/add any decrease/increase in deferred revenues, as this would indicate a derecognition of cash that had been paid in advance/recognition of cash paid in advance of revenues. \nNext, they would subtract the cash paid to suppliers. This is calculated by taking the cost of goods sold, adding/subtracting any increase/decrease in inventory, and then adding/subtracting any decrease/increase in accounts payable. \nThen there would need to be adjustments to the salaries and wages expense, which is quite straightforward. The cash flow here is just the expense on the income statement minus/plus the increase/decrease in wages payable. \nOnce that is accounted for, what remains are adjustments to operating expenses, interest expense, and income tax expense. To adjust operating expenses, simply take reported operating expenses, add/subtract any increase/decrease to prepaid expense and subtract/add any increase in expense liabilities. \nInterest cash flow is affected only by interest payable. Add/subtract any increase/decrease. \nAnd finally, for the tax related cash flow, there are three balance sheet items to inspect - taxes receiveable (aka deferred tax assets), taxes payable, and deferred tax liabilities. If taxes receivable increases, then there is a greater tax cash outflow. If taxes payable or deferred tax liabilities increase, then there is a lesser tax cash outflow.| |4.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
37|2024-09-21|How does the indirect method for cash flows from operating activities work?|Adjustments are made to net income for 1) any non-operating items, which are added back if they were an expense or subtracted if it was income (they will be on the investing or financing cash flows); 2) any non-cash expenses, like depreciation/amortisation, which are added back; and 3) adjustments for changes in current working asset/liability items. In terms of that last one - increases/decreases to assets, like accounts receivable, are subtracted/added, and decreases/increases to liabilities, like accounts payable, are subtracted/added.| |4.0|indirect method,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
38|2024-09-25|How do you convert from the indirect method to the direct method of measuring operating cash flows?|There's a three step process. Step one is to disaggregate net income into total revenue and total expenses, which can then be split up into various categories needed for the direct method. Next, any non-operating items are removed, whether that requires adding or subtracting them. Finally, the categories are adjusted for the changes in the relevant working capital accounts.| |4.0|direct method,indirect method,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
39|2024-09-08|How do you calculate financing cash flows?|If long-term debt increases/decreases, this is a financing cash inflow/outflow, as they have issued/retired debt by selling more/repaying the principle. If stock decreases/increases, this is a financing cash outflow/inflow. Dividends are an outflow, and can be calculated by taking beginning retained earnings, adding net income, and subtracting ending retained earnings.| |3.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
40|2024-10-04|How do you calculate investing cash flows?|Investing out flows are typically explicitly stated. Calculating in flows requires more calculation. Start with beginning equipment (or land, etc.) and add the equipment purchases for the year, then subtract ending equipment value. The difference is the historical cost of the equipment that has been sold. We need to adjust this by its accumulated depreceiation: to do so, take the beginning accumulated depreciation, add the depreciation expense for the year from the income statement, and subtract the ending accumulated depreciation. The difference was the accumulated depreciation on the equipment sold. Subtracting this from the historical cost gives the book value of equipment sold. Finally, add/subtract any gains/losses arising from disposal of equipment on the income statement - this gives the investing cash in flow.| |4.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
41|2024-09-21|How do sources of cash vary as a company moves through the growth cycle?|A start-up or early stage growth company would likely be relying heavily on financing cash inflows to cover a negative operating cash flow while they build up inventories, invest in capex and perhaps research, and extend credit to customers to capture market share. A more mature company would be expected to not only have a positive operating cash flow, but one that could also cover its investing activities, which is to say free cash flow.| |4.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
42|2024-09-08|What approaches are there for common-size analysis of the statement of cash flows?|There are two methods. Either by dividing all the inflows by the total inflows, and the same for each outflow. Or by dividing each item by net revenue. This latter approach has the advantage of providing a way to forecast cash flows once revenue has been forecast.| |3.0|ratios,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
43|2024-09-19|What is free cash flow?|The remaining cash flow from operations once capex has been covered.| |4.0|free cash flow,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
44|2024-09-25|What is free cash flow to firm and how is it calculated?|The cash flows available to both debt and equity investors. Net income + non-cash charges + interest(1 - tax rate) - capex - working capital expenditures, or CFO + interest(1 - tax rate) - capex. In the second one, interest does not need to be added back if it is recorded as a financing outflow, and if interest and dividends received are recorded on the investing activities section, they also need to be added back.| |4.0|free cash flow,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
45|2024-09-25|What is free cash flow to equity and how is it calculated?|The cash flow available to equity investors after covering capex and debt repayments. CFO - capex +/- net borrowing/net debt repayment.| |4.0|free cash flow,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1

57|2024-09-19|What are the three key principles of capital allocation?|1. Managers must consider after-tax cash flows rather than accounting measures like net income, to give a clearer idea what is available for investment and what previous investments are actually returning to the business. \n2. Only incremental cash flows should be considered - cash that has already been spent or earned should have no effect on capital allocation decisions. \n3. It is imoprtant to get the timings of the cash flows right as shifting them by a year can have a serious impact on expected returns.| |4.0|capital allocation,capital investments,corporate issuers
58|2024-09-19|What are the broad categories of pitfalls for capital allocation?|Cognitive errors and behavioural biases.| |4.0|capital allocation,capital investments,corporate issuers
59|2024-09-20|Give examples of the types of pitfalls in capital allocation.|Cognitive errors: internal forecasting errors, ranging from incorrect estimates of cash flows, returns, or similar, which lead to mistaken valuations of projects; ignoring the cost of internal financing, where managers will frequently consider projects financed with free cash flow as being 'free' in comparison to expensive external debt or equity raises, while it is in fact a form of equity financing, where the cash could be return to investors instead; and ignoring the effects of inflation in adjusting discount rates on cash flows. Behavioural biases: inertia, which is where capital allocators anchor their investment decisions based on previous allocations, regardless of the results (0.9+ correlation); basing investment decisions on accounting measures such as EPS rather than an NPV calculation, often because their compensation is tied to these accounting metrics; pet project bias; and failure to consider alternative investment ideas or aleternative scenarios.| |4.0|capital allocation,capital investments,corporate issuers
60|2024-09-25|What are the different types of real options?|Timing option - where the firm may have the option to delay the whole or part of the project until there will perhaps be more or better information. \nSizing option - the firm may have abandonment options, when they can choose to terminate early and recover some costs, which they should choose to do if recovery ever exceeds net present value; they may have a growth option to increase the size of the investment. \nFlexibility option - price setting option, to charge a higher or lower price if demand differs from expectations; production flexibility options, where they can pay for overtime, extra shifts, run machines longer etc. \nFundamental option - where output might depend on esxternal factors, such as gold price for a gold-mining firm. If prices were too low, new mines might not be dug.| |4.0|real options,corporate issuers
61|2024-09-18|What is a real option?|Rights but not obligations of a firm to take an action at some point in the future.| |4.0|real options,corporate issuers
62|2024-09-29|How can an analyst incorporate real options into a net present value calculation?|They can ignore the real options; they can interate the options by subtracting incremental cost and adding expected cash flows from them; or they can perform a probability weighted calculation with all the potential cash flows under different scenarios.| |4.0|real options,corporate issuers
63|2024-09-25|What about inventories present a risk to a company?|Holding costs, risk of spoilage, risk of obsolescence.| |4.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
64|2024-09-08|How is inventory measured under the two reporting standards?|Under IFRS, it is recorded at the lower of net realisable value and historical cost. If there is a write-down required, the cost is reduced to match the net realisable value. If net realisable value subsequently increases, the write-down can be reversed, but only to the previous cost. Under US GAAP, all inventories except those measured under LIFO are reported at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with the same process of write-downs as IFRS. The difference here is that US GAAP doesn't allow for reversals of write-downs, so managers are likely to be unwilling to take that step unless there is strong evidence it is required. If the inventory is using the LIFO method, then it is measured at the lower of cost or market value, where market value is replacement value bounded above by net realisable value and below by net realisable value less a normal profit margin.| |3.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
65|2024-09-15|What is an inventory write-down?|When net realisable value is lower than the cost of the inventory on the balance sheet, and so the cost must be reduced to the NRV, recording an impairment expense on the income statement. Under IFRS, this can be reversed if NRV increases, up to the maximum of the original cost, but not under US GAAP.| |3.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
66|2024-09-20|How are inventories of agricultural/forestry products/mineral products valued?|At net realisable value, with any gains or losses recorded in the income statement.| |4.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
67|2024-09-19|What effect does a write-down have on financial ratios?|Because the company records an impairment expense, any profitability ratios are reduced - hence management's frequent reluctance to perform write-downs. However, by reducing inventory, and therefore assets, many activity ratios look better.| |4.0|inventories,ratios,financial statement analysis 1
68|2024-09-25|What effect does the reversal of a write-down have on the income statement?|It reduces cost of sales by the same amount.| |4.0|inventories,income statement,financial statement analysis 1
69|2024-09-25|What is the effect of inflation and deflation on inventories, cost of sales, and gross margin?|Under the FIFO method, in an inflationary environment, inventories will more accurately reflect current replacement costs and cost of sales will be lower than other methods of inventory valuation, meaning gross profit and therefore taxes will be higher; the reverse is true for deflationary environments. \nIf LIFO is being used (under US GAAP), then cost of sales more accurately represents current replacement costs under an inflationary environment and inventories will be lower as they contain the older items, meaning gross margin and profit will be lower; the reverse is true for inflationary environments.| |4.0|inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
70|2024-09-08|What disclosures are required around inventories?|1. The accounting policies used in measuring inventories, including the cost formula (FIFO, LIFO, etc.) \n2. The cost of inventories broken down across segments like raw materials, finished products, etc. \n3. The total carrying amount of inventories at fair value less cost to sell. \n4. The amount of inventory recognised as expense (cost of sales). \n5. The amount of any write-downs during the period. \n6. The amount of any reversal of write-downs during the period (IFRS only). \n7. The circumstances leading to any reversals of write-downs. \n8. The carrying amount of inventories pledged as securities for liabilities. \n9. Significant estimates involved in inventory valuation (US GAAP). \n10. Any material income from LIFO liquidation (US GAAP).| |3.0|inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
71|2024-09-15|What is the inventory turnover ratio?|Cost of goods sold / inventory (either average or end-of-period)| |3.0|ratios,inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
72|2024-09-21|What is days of inventory on hand?|Number of days in period / inventory turnover ratio| |4.0|ratios,inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
73|2024-09-20|What might an analyst be able to infer from ratios like inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, and gross profit margin?|High inventory turnover ratio and low days of inventory on hand could either indicate a company that is very efficient with its investment in inventory and generates lots of revenue without needing to invest much, or it could indicate a company with poor inventory management that is likely to miss out on sales opportunities and suffer from supply problems; similar but opposite statements can be made for the reverse situation. An analyst would need to compare the ratios with industry norms and investigate the disclosures and management discussions. Gross profit margin indicates how much of revenue is being retained versus spent on goods to sell - it is likely to be higher for luxury or high-value goods than for something like consumer staples or products and services with a low barrier to entry.| |4.0|ratios,inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
74|2024-09-15|What does the inventory valuation allowance represent?|The total amount of inventory write-downs for the inventory reported on the balance sheet, allowing for the determination of historical cost by adding the valuation allowance to the reported carrying amount.| |3.0|inventories,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
75|2024-09-08|What are the criteria an intangible asset must meet to be recognised in the balance sheet?|1. Indentifiable (separable from the company). \n2. It must be controlled by the company. \n3. It must be expected to generate a future economic benefit. \n4. The expected future economic benefit will flow to the company. \n5. The cost of the asset must be able to be reliabily measured.| |1.0|long-term assets,intangible assets,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
76|2024-09-19|What are the three methods of coming to own an intangible asset?|Purchasing it other than through general business acquisitions; by internally creating the asset (R&D, for example); or as part of a business acquisition.| |4.0|long-term assets,intangible assets,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
77|2024-09-10|How are intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions recorded?|The cost of the purchase must be identified against any purchased assets or assumed liabilitiesat fair value of those assets/liabilities, at which point they are recorded at historical cost less amortisaation/impairment like any normal intangible asset. Any excess is recorded as goodwill, an intangible asset with indefinite lifespan tested annually for impairment.| |3.0|long-term assets,intangible assets,goodwill,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
78|2024-09-19|How are intangible assets recorded when they are created internally?|It varies slightly under the two accounting methods. IFRS requires that research costs are expensed, but development costs can be capitalised once feasability is established, meaning they will be expensed via amortisation from that point. Under US GAAP, all research and development costs are expensed as incurred, unless the asset is a piece of software, in which case devlopment costs can be capitalised once technical feasability is established. Internal development costs are recorded as financing outflows, whereas acquisition costs would be investing outflows.| |4.0|long-term assets,intangible assets,income statement,balance sheet,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
79|2024-09-09|How are intangible assets purchased other than through a business acquisition recorded?|They are recorded as fair value (which is deemed to be purchase cost) less amortisation and impairment,| |3.0|long-term assets,intangible assets,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
80|2024-09-15|When do impairment charges occur and for what amounts?|Impairment occurs when the recoverable value of an asset declines below the carrying amount. Under IFRS, recoverable value is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and fair value in use, which is the present value of estimated future cash flows; the impairment charge is the difference between the two. Under US GAAP, the test for recoverability and the amount to impair are separated: the carrying amount of the asset is considered not recoverable if the unidscounted future cash flows for the asset are less than the carrying amount. If so, the impairment charge is the difference between the carrying amount and the asset's fair value.| |3.0|long-term assets,impairment,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
81|2024-09-08|How are the various types of asset tested for impairment?|PPE: carrying amount is historical cost less depreciation, and the assets are tested for impairment only if there is indication of impairment. Intanginble assets with finite life: carrying amount is historical cost less amortisation, and the assets are tested for impairment only if there is indication of impairment. Intangible assets with infinite life: these are tested annually for impairment and suffer no amortisation. Long-live assets held-for-sale rather than for use: when an asset is reclassified as held-for-sale, which is when management intends to sell it and it is likely that it will be sold, then the asset is tested for impairment and written-down (if necessary) to fair value less costs to sell, after which point it is not depreciated/amortised.| |1.0|long-term assets,intangible assets,impairment,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
82|2024-09-29|When can impairment charges be reversed?|Under IFRs, impairment charges can be reversed if net realisable value increases above carrying cost; they can only be reversed up to the original carrying amount. Under US GAAP, assets held-for-use cannot have impairment reversed; assets held-for-sale can, under the same conditions as IFRS.| |4.0|long-term assets,impairment,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
83|2024-09-18|When are assets derecognised and what is the process?|Assets are derecognised when the company disposes of them or no longer expects economic benefits through their use or disposal. Disposal can be through selling, through abandonment, through exchange, or through distribution. When assets are sold, cash increases, assets are decreased, and a gain or loss is recognised as the difference between selling price and carrying amount. Abandonment is similar, though the 'selling price' is zero, so there is only a loss and a decrease to assets. When assets are exchanged, assets are reduced by the carrying amount of the asset given up and increased by the fair value of the asset given up, unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident. The difference is recorded as a gain or loss.| |4.0|long-term assets,income statement,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1

88|2024-09-08|What disclosures are required for PPE under IFRS?|Under IFRS, the company must disclose the measurement basis, the depreciation method, the useful life used for depreciation, the gross carrying amount, and beginning and ending accumulated depreciation with a reconciliation of the carrying amount; if the revaluation model is used, the date of revaluation, details of obtaining fair value, as well as the carrying amount under the cost model and the revaluation surplus must be disclosed.| |1.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
89|2024-09-08|What disclosures are required for intangible assets under US GAAP?|A company must disclose the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortisation in total and by major classes of intangible assets, the aggregate amortisation expense for the period, and the estimated amortisation expense for the next five fiscal years.| |0.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
90|2024-09-21|What disclosures are required for intangible assets under IFRS?|A company must disclose whether the useful lives are indefinite or finite; if they are the latter, then the same rules apply as for tangible assets; if they are indefinite,they company must disclose the carrying amount of the asset, and why it is considered to have an indefinite life.| |3.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
91|2024-09-08|What disclosures are required around impairments?|Under IFRS, the amount of losses and reversals for each class of asset, along with where they are recognised on the financial statements and the main events leading to the impairments and reversals. Under US GAAP, there is no reversal of impairments for assets held for use. They must diclose a description of the impaired asset, what led to the impairment, the method of determining fair value, the amount of impairment loss, and where it is recognised on the financial statements.| |1.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
92|2024-09-19|What is a lease?|A financial contract that grants on entity, the lessee, the right to use an asset of another entity, the lessor. For a contract to be considered a lease, it must identify a specific asset, the lessee must gain most of the economic benefit of the asset for the duration of the lease, and the the lessee must have sole discretion on how the asset is put to use.| |3.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
93|2024-09-29|What are the advantages of using leases?|They are more cash efficient, needing little to no down payment; they are generally cheaper than forms of lending like bank loans, as they are essentially secured borrowing, since the asset can simply be repossessed in case of non-payment; particularly for the lessee, there is reduced risk of obsolescence.| |4.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
94|2024-09-08|What are the two types of leases?|Financing leases, which are akin to purchasing the asset, and operating leases, which look more like renting the asset. More specifically, a lease is a financing lease if it meets any of the following five criteria: the lease gives ownership of the asset to the lessee; there is an option in the contract for the lessee to purchase the asset and they are likely to do so; the present value of the lease equals or almost equals the value of the asset; the term of the lease covers most of the asset's useful life; the lessor has no alternative use for the asset.| |3.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
95|2024-09-28|How do lessees report leases under the IFRS?|They report operating and financing leases identically. At lease inception, they create a lesae payable liability and a right-of-use asseet, each equal to the present value of the lease cotnract. After inception, the liability is reduced according to the effective interest rate method (payments less interest at the effective interest rate) and the ROU asset is amortised, often on a straight-line basis, meaning that the two accounts often diverge. On the statements: the lease liability net of principal repayments and the ROU asset net of accumulated amortisation are recorded on the balance sheet; the interest expense on the lease liability and the amortisation expense for the ROU asset are reported separately on the income statement; the principal repayment component of the lease repayment is reported as a financing cash outflow, and the interest expense is reported under either operating or financing activities based on the company's accounting policies.| |4.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
96|2024-09-10|How do lessees report leases under US GAAP?|"The finance accounting model is identical to IFRS. For US GAAP, the difference is that the ROU amortisation expense is the same as the principal repayment on the liability (payment less interest), meaning the two accounts are always equal. On the statements: the lease liability net of principal repayments and the ROU asset net of accumulated amortisation are recorded on the balance sheet; the interest expense on the lease liability and the amortisation expense for the ROU asset are reported as a single line item on the income statement, ""lease expense""; the entire lease payment is reported as a single item under operating cash flows."| |2.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
97|2024-09-08|How do lessors report financing leases?|For both IFRS and US GAAP, the lessor dercognises the asset on their balance sheet and recognises a lease payments receivable asset on their balance sheet equal to the presnt value of the lease payments - the difference is recognised as a gain or loss. The lease payments receivable are reduced in accordence with the effective interest rate, with interest income recorded as revenue if leasing is a primary business activity. On the statements: lease receivable net of principal proceeds is reported on the balance sheet; interest income is reported on the income statement, as revenue if leasing is the primary business; the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows.| |1.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
98|2024-09-08|How do lessors report operating leases?|For both IFRS and US GAAP, the asset is not derecognised since it is not effectively owned by the lessee, meaning it continues to depreciate on the balance sheet. Lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis, and interest income is not recognised as the transaction is not considered a financing transaction. On the statements: the balance sheet is unaffected; lease revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis on the income statement, along with depreciation expense of the asset; the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows.| |2.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
99|2024-09-15|When is compensation expense recognised?|If the compensation vests immediately or shortly thereafter, as with salary or bonuses, then it is recognised as an expense incurred in the period. If the compensation vests after a period of service, then the expense is amortised over the period on a straight-line basis.| |3.0|liabilities,financial statement analysis 1
100|2024-09-18|What are some examples of deferred compensation?|Defined contribution pension plans, defined benefit pension plans, stock grants, and stock option grants are all examples of deferred compensation.| |3.0|liabilities,financial statement analysis 1
101|2024-09-29|How are defined contribution pension plans accounted for?|The pension contribution from the employer is incurred as an expense in the period, reducing cash on the balance sheet. If some or all of the contribution hasn't been paid by the end of the period, a liability account is recorded.| |4.0|liabilities,financial statement analysis 1
102|2024-09-08|How are defined benefit pension plans accounted for?|Afer estimating future obligations and discounting back to a present value using the yield on a high-grade corporate bond as the discount rate, the obligation is compared to the fund out of which the benefits are to be paid. If the funds assets are greater, then a net pension asset is recorded, and a net pension liability if there is a shortfall. | |1.0|liabilities,financial statement analysis 1
103|2024-09-12|How are changes in net pension assets or liabilities recognised under the two accounting standards?|Under IFRS, there are three components: employee's cost of service, which is the present value of the increase in the obligation from the employee working another year; the net interest expense or income on the beginning asset or liability, which is based on the yield of a high-grade corporate bond; and remeasurements, which include actuarial gains and losses and the acutual returns on the plan outside of the previous two; the first two aspects are recognised as a pension expense on the income statement, and the last aspect is recognised under other comprehensive income. \nUnder US GAAP, there are five components: cost of employee's service for the period; interest expense accrued on the beginning pension obligation; expected return on plan assets, which is a reduction in the amount of expense recognised; past service costs; and actuarial gains and losses. The first three aspects are recognised as pension expense and the other two are recognised through other comprehensive income and then amortised into expense over time.| |2.0|liabilities,financial statement analysis 1
104|2024-10-03|What is theory behind share-based compensation and what are the disadvantages?|In theory, share-based compensation better aligns compensation for employees with the performance of the stock and therefore how much money the shareholders are making. In practice, however, few employees have outsize impact on share price and it can also pervert risk aversion, either to being more risk-seeking or more risk-averse.| |4.0|liabilities,share-based compensation,financial statement analysis 1
105|2024-10-02|How are share grants expensed?|Although no cash changes hands, companies generally estimate compensation expense at fair value (usually market value) at the time of granting and then expense it evenly over the employee service period, which is generally the current period unless the grants have a longer vesting period.| |4.0|liabilities,share-based compensation,financial statement analysis 1
106|2024-09-15|How are stock options expensed?|Although no cash changes hands, companies generally estimate compensation expense at fair value at the time of granting and then expense it evenly over the employee service period, which is generally the current period unless the grants have a longer vesting period. The difficulty comes in calculating fair value, as there are a number of models for doing so. The guidance is to use an estimation method that is consistent with fair value, is based on sound economic theory, and substantively reflects all aspects of the award.| |3.0|liabilities,share-based compensation,financial statement analysis 1
107|2024-09-08|How do you treat deferred tax liabilities when they are not expected to reverse?|As equity, since there will be no required tax payment in the future.| |3.0|presentation and disclosure,liabilities,tax,financial statement analysis 1
108|2024-09-14|What do lessees need to disclose regarding leases?|Quantitative and qualitative information about its leases, judgements made to comply with lease accounting requirements,and the amounts recognised in the financial statements along with their locations. Specifically: the carrying amount of right-of-use assets by class of underlying asset; total cash outflow for leases; interest expense on lease liabilities; depreciation charges for ROU assets by class of underlying asset; additions to ROU assets; and a maturity analysis of lease liabilities, including the nature of leasing activities, future cash outflows to which the lessee is potentially exposed that aren't already reflected in the measurements, restrictions or covenants imposed by leases, and sale and leaseback transactions.| |2.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
109|2024-09-08|What do lessors need to disclose regarding leases?|For financing leases: the amount of selling profit or loss; finance income on the net investment in the lease; income relating to variable lease payments; qualitative and quantitative explanation of significant changes in the carrying amount of the net investment; maturity analysis of the lease payments receivable, including undiscounted lease payments on an annual basis for each of the first five years and a total amount for remaining years. For operating leases: lease income with separate disclosure relating to income from variable lease payments not based on an index or rate; disaggregated information about each class of PPE; the same maturity analysis as for financing leases, including the cash flows.| |2.0|leases,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
110|2024-09-12|What disclosures are required for pension plans?|Defined contribution plans tend to simply require disclosure of the expense recognised on the income statement. Defined benefit plans tend to require disclosures explaining the characteristics and associated risks of the plan; identifying and explaining the amounts in its financial statements (i.e. net pension asset or liability); and describing how its defined benefit plans may affect the amount, timing, and uncertainty of the entity's future cash flows.| |2.0|pensions,liabilities,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
111|2024-09-15|What is accounting profit?|The profit reported on the income statement, not including a provision for tax expense.| |3.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
112|2024-09-08|What is taxable income?|The amount of income against which an entity will pay tax, generally determined by the amount of cash earned in the various regions in which it operates.| |3.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
113|2024-09-29|How do temporary and permanent taxation differences arise?|Differences between either asset or liability tax and reporting bases or differences between accounting profit and taxable income. Temporary differences are those that are expected to reverse in future periods, while permanent differences will not, and will cause a discrepancy between statutory and effective tax rates.| |4.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
114|2024-09-19|What are common causes of taxation differences?|1. Differences in timings of when items are reported for accounting purposes versus taxation purposes. \n2. Differences in what items are reported for accounting purposes versus taxation purposes. \n3. Differences in what items are considered deductible for accounting purposes versus taxation purposes. \n4. The use of previous years' losses to offset taxable income (tax loss carryforward). \n5. Adjustments to previous years' accounting that isn't recognised for taxation purposes.| |3.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
115|2024-09-08|What are the categories of temporary tax differences and when do they arise?|Taxable temporary differences, which are liabilities that arise when the carrying amount of an asset is higher than its tax base or the carrying amount of a liability is lower than its tax base - or when accounting profit is higher than taxable income; and deductible temporary differences, which arise when the carrying amount of an asset it lower than its tax base or the carrying amount of a liability is higher than its tax base - or when accounting profit is lower than taxable income.| |2.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
116|2024-10-04|What are common exmaples of permanent tax differences?|Income or expense items that are not deductible for tax purposes but are for reporting purposes, like fines and penalties, or tax credits that directly reduce taxes. This will result in a difference between the effective and statutory income tax rates.| |4.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
117|2024-09-28|What is tax expense?|The aggregation of tax required on operations in the current period and any changes to taxes receivable or payable during the period.| |4.0|tax,income statement,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 2
118|2024-09-29|What happens to deferred tax assets/liabilites when the statutory tax rate changes?|If the deferred tax accounts are net assets, then an increase in the tax rate increases its value and a decrease would decrease its value. If its a net obligation, then an increase in the statutory rate will increase the obligation and a decrease would decrease the obligation.| |4.0|tax,income statement,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 2
119|2024-09-29|What happens to tax assets if the future economic benefit is not likely to be recognised?|Under IFRS, the asset should be reversed. Under US GAAP, a valuation allowance should be created that decreases the asset to the amount that is more likely to be recovered than not.| |4.0|tax,income statement,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 2
120|2024-09-29|What are the three tax rates that generally interest analysts?|Statutory tax rate, which is the regulatory rate of tax on income; the effective tax rate, which is the ratio of tax expense to accounting profit; and the cash tax rate, which is the ratio of cash paid as tax to accounting profit.| |4.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
121|2024-10-04|How do analysts use the effective tax rate and cash tax rate of a company?|To forecast tax expense and forecast actual tax paid as cash.| |4.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
122|2024-09-29|Is an effective tax rate consistently below statutory tax rate a cause for concern?|Not necessarily, as there are many valid reasons for this to be the case, but an analyst should investigate further as to why this is the case and whether it's due to bad practice.| |4.0|tax,income statement,financial statement analysis 2
123|2024-09-19|What is earnings quality?|Earnings quality refers to two concepts: the sustainability of earnings, which is the ability of the company to keep producing those or increasing earnings; and adequacy of earnings, which refers to whether earnings cover the cost of investment and also meet the required rate of return.| |3.0|earnings,earnings quality,financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
124|2024-09-29|Describe the spectrum of reporting quality.|In order of decreasing quality: reports that conform to GAAP standards, that are decision-useful and describe good earnings quality; then reports that conform to GAAP standards, that are decision-useful, but perhaps describe low earnings quality; next, reports that are within GAAP standards, but have biassed choices; closely linked are those within GAAP standards but have earnings management embedded (essentially intentionally biassed choices); then there is reporting that is not compliant with GAAP standards; and finally fraudulent or fictitious reporting.| |4.0|reporting quality,earnings quality,financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
125|2024-09-08|What is aggressive accounting?|Accounting practices that serve to inflate some aspect of the reporting, generally some profit metric.| |3.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
126|2024-10-01|What is conservative accounting?|Accounting practices that reduce profitability metrics in some way, perhaps by making choices that allow some profit from this year to be reported next year, or through early reporting of expenses. | |4.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
127|2024-10-04|What issues are associated with aggressive accounting?|The primary issue with aggressive accounting is one of earnings sustainability. When aggressive choices are made, they frequently cannot be made year after year, and so future profit can be less than expected.| |4.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
128|2024-09-11|What are some empirically suggested advantages of conservative accounting?|1. Given asymmetrical information, it may protect the contracting party with less information and greater risk, such as lenders of debt to corporate issuers and shareholders of companies. \n2. It reduces the possibility of litigation and therefore litigation costs, as a company is less likely to be sued for understating good news or overstating bad news than the reverse. \n3. It may protect the interests of regulators and politicians, so they aren't held reponsible for poor reporting practices of companies. \n4. Tax and reporting are linked in some jurisdictions, meaning that conservative reporting choices must be made to gain tax deductions.| |2.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
129|2024-10-01|What are some motivations for over- or under-reporting earnings?|Compensation, which is frequently tied to stock performance for managers, and career opportunities, where managers fear not being offered future roles due to poor company performance.| |4.0|earnings quality,financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
130|2024-10-01|What is the fraud triangle?|This is the concept used to explain why or how divergent or incorrect accounting choices are made: opportunity, motivation or pressure, and rationalisation. Opportunity might be something like poor internal controls or an ineffective board, or even lax reporting standards in the region; motivation or pressure might be the need to meet some financial metric for purposes of compensation, for example; and rationalisation is the ability to explain away the behaviour, either to oneself or to another party, when it is clearly suboptimal or fraudulent.| |4.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
131|2024-09-12|What are the three main mechanisms for ensuring financial reporting quality?|Market regulators, auditors, and private contracts.| |2.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
132|2024-10-01|How do private contracts affect reporting quality?|Private contracts frequently come with obligations known as covenants, such as maintaining a minimum coverage of interest payments. These will come with increased oversight, generally from the other party in the contract, which can help ensure financial reporting quality. However, it can also incentivise earnings management to meet the strictures of those same covenants.| |4.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
133|2024-09-19|How do market regulators ensure reporting quality?|They are the enforcers without which the standards set by the private standards-setting companies would be meaningless; they can also add their own standards or overrule standards. There are a number of things they require: 1. That companies register their securities before they can be sold to the public, which requires the submission of financial statements and overview of business outlook, etc. \n2. There are disclosure requirements, where companies must submit periodic reports on their financial position that meet the standards of the country. \n3. Those reports must be audited by independent auditors who review the reports and confirm that they have been made with all correct and available information according the required standards, highlighting their reasoning and any issues. \n4. Management commentary is generally required to discuss the business and reporting decisions. \n5. Repsonsibility statements from the people creating the reports that attest to their correctness, which can come with legal penalties if not done right. \n6. Regulatory review of filings generally takes place randomly or periodically to ensure the requirements are being met. \n7. Enforcement mechanisms such as fines, suspensions or disbarment of market participation, and criminal prosecutions are all tools used to ensure compliance with the above requirements.| |3.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
134|2024-10-01|What role do auditors play and what do are their limitations?|They issue opinions on 1) whether the financial reports meet reporting standards and 2) whether the information contained within them fairly represent the underlying position of the company. Those opinions can be unqualified opinions, qualified opinions, adverse opinions, or disclaimer of opinion. This is helpful, but there are limitations: firstly, they rely on information from the company, so if the company deliberately lies to them then their opinions can be incorrect; their work involves sampling, so mistakes or inadequacies can be missed through bad luck; and there are competing incentives, as they are being paid by the company they are auditing would quite like to be paid in the future for that work, let alone the other work they are likely doing for them simultaneously.| |4.0|auditing,financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
135|2024-09-29|How do we estimate the costs for different sources of funding for capital investment projects?|The cost of debt funding can be estimated from historical rates or, in a more forward-looking manner, using the costs of more recent financing for similar financing. The cost of equity funding is difficult to estimate properly, but a reasonable proxy is the historical return of the S&P500, about 10%.| |4.0|cost of capital,capital structure,corporate issuers
136|2024-09-08|What are the two methods of estimating weights of capital and which is preferred?|Using either their market value proportions or target weights provided by management, which are typically on a book value basis. The market value weights are more comonly used because book values reflect historical prices, while investors' opportunity costs are better represented by current market prices.| |3.0|cost of capital,capital structure,corporate issuers
137|2024-10-02|What is the formula for calculating the weighted average cost of capital?|It is the weighted average of either book price or market price of debt and equity; if interest payments are tax deductible, then the debt cost is weighted by a modifier of 1 - tax rate.| |4.0|cost of capital,capital structure,corporate issuers
138|2024-09-29|What are the components of an interest rate?|The risk-free interest rate, which is the interest rate for a completely risk free security in a non-inflationary environment. The inflation premium, which reflects the average inflation rate expected over the maturity of the debt. When added to the risk-free rate, this gives the nominal risk-free rate, typically reflective by short-term government debt. The default risk premium, which compensates investors for the possibility of non-payment by the borrower. The liquidity premium, which provides compensation for the risk of loss relative to fair value if the investment must be quickly converted to cash. Maturity premium, which compensates investors for the increased sensitivity of the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity is extended.| |4.0|interest rates,rates and returns,quantitative methods
139|2024-09-08|What are the different ways to view an interest rate?|A required rate of return; a discount rate; or an opportunity cost.| |3.0|interest rates,rates and returns,quantitative methods
140|2024-09-19|What might managers do to manage earnings, either up or down?|To manage them up, they might recognise revenue sooner, report non-recurring revenue as part of continuining operations, delay recognition of expenses, measure assets as higher in value, and measure liabilities as lower in obligations. To manage them down, the reverse might be done, particularly in terms of recognising expenses earlier such as amortisation and depreciation expenses.| |3.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
141|2024-09-08|What are some common ways that companies adjust GAAP measures to pro forma earnings?|They remove restructuring charges, amortisation and depreciation expenses (especially of goodwill), remove equity-based compensation charges as they are non-cash, remove impairment charges for long-lived assets, and remove litigation charges. They may also remove 'non-recurring' items that are, in fact, quite likely to recur.| |2.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
142|2024-10-03|How do US GAAP and IFRS standards handle non-GAAP measurements?|They each demand an explanation of the use of any non-GAAP measurements, including why they have been used and what benefit they add to statement users, as well as a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. US GAAP specifically requires that this GAAP measure is displayed with equal prominence alongside the reconciliation, and disclosures must be made about any additional purposes, if material, for which the non-GAAP measures are used.| |4.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
143|2024-09-19|What is the difference between free on board shipping point and free on board destination?|In the former, the customer takes title to the goods and bears the risk of loss at the time the goods leave the seller's loading dock, whereas, in the latter, this occurs upon arrival at the destination. This changes when the sale and profit can be recognised.| |3.0|financial reporting quality,financial statement analysis 2
144|2024-09-08|In what ways can management alter the statements of cash flows and how can analysts detect them?|Common ways: include alterations to the working capital accounts such as stretching accounts payable, which can be detected by examining those accounts; through choices around interest expensing versus capitalisation, which can be detected through examining the accounting versus cash flow for these items; and through choices left open in reporting standards, such as classifying dividends paid as a financing outflow rather than an operating outflow, or interest paid and interest and dividends received as financing and investing flows respectively instead of operating flows. There can also be unconsolidated special purpose entities that are outside of the view of investors. Transacting with such an entity may initially produce the appearance of a positive or negative cash flow for the controlling company.

The heterogeneity or homogeneity of the business should be considered, as businesses with many different operating segments can make it difficult to find comparisons. They do not reveal everything about a company and an analyst will still need to make judgements about what they show about the underlying business.

249|2024-09-15|What are some different market pricing rules?|The uniform pricing rule, where all trades are executed at the same price chosen to maximise the amount traded; the discriminatory pricing rule, where the quote of the order that arrives first determines trade price; or the derivative pricing rule, where the price is derived from another market.| |3.0|market organisation and structure,equity investments
250|2024-09-15|How do continuous markets typically prioritise orders?|First by price priority, with better bids and offers trading first; then by display precedence, with orders that display more information trading first; and then by timing precedence.| |3.0|market organisation and structure,equity investments

253|2024-09-15|What are the key considerations for the construction of a market index?|1. The target market the index should match. \n2. Which securities should go into the index from that market. \n3. What weighting should be given to each security. \n4. When the index should be rebalanced. \n5. When the selection and weighting decision should be re-examined.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
254|2024-09-19|What does it mean to rebalance an index?|It is the process of adjusting the weights of the constituents to reflect changes in their weights due to changes in their prices over the previous period, or to account for coprorate actions between rebalancing dates.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
255|2024-09-08|What does it mean to reconstitute an index and what problem arises from this process?|It is the process of removing constituents that no longer match the target market of the index and adding new ones that do. It can lead to buying pressure on potential new entrants and selling pressure on those potentially being removed, which can raise or lower the prices of those companies more than they should.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
256|2024-09-21|What are some of the major uses of market indexes?|They can be used as gauges of market sentiment; as proxies for measuring and modelling returns, systematic risk, and risk-adjusted performance; as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models; as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios; or as model proftolios for such investment products as index funds and exchange traded funds.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
257|2024-09-10|What are common ways to structure equity indexes?|As broad market indexes, covering a whole market like US equities; as multi-market indexes, typically grouped by size (developed, developing, frontier) and geographically; as sector indexes, such as consumer goods, energy, finance; as style indexes, such as small-, medium-, and large-cap, value, or growth.| |2.0|security market indexes,equity investments
258|2024-09-12|What can you remember about fixed-income indexes?|It's a more complicated task than creating equity indexes, for a couple of reasons: there are a huge number of different issues of fixed-income instruments which can be segregated by country, region, type of issuer, type of issue, whether there is non-payment protection, credit rating, maturity, coupon, and so on, along with individual issuers being able to issue multiple bonds, and there being more issuers once governments are accounted for. There is also a lot of turnover as bonds mature and new ones are issued - coupled with the thousands of instruments that might make up an index, it makes them very hard to replicate for investors. Additionally, the bond market is both dealer-based and highly illiquid, making it difficult and expensive to frequently and accurately price the issues.| |2.0|security market indexes,equity investments
259|2024-09-19|How do commodity indexes work?|They are based on futures contracts. The index returns reflect the risk-free rate, the changes in future prices of the underlying commodities, and the roll yield.| |3.0|commodities,security market indexes,equity investments
260|2024-09-15|How are commodity indexes weighted?|There is no standardised approach, and it will vary depending on index provider.| |3.0|commodities,security market indexes,equity investments
261|2024-09-21|What sorts of real estate indexes are there?|Appraisal indexes, which provide standardised and objective assessments of real estate value by aggregating individual property appraisals; repeat sale indexes, which measure the change in property prices as they are sold multiple times, though this can easily suffer from selection bias; and REIT indexes.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
262|2024-09-19|How do hedge fund indexes work?|There are a number of databases worldwide that track hedge fund returns and provide indexes. However, there are no reporting requirements for hedge funds, and so it's down to choice whether they provide that information to the databases. This means that there is a great deal of variety between indexes, and also that there is a real tendency towards both selection bias (not reporting bad results) and survivorship bias (failed hedge funds stop reporting).| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
263|2024-09-11|What are some different ways to weight a security market index?|Price weighting, equal weighting, market-capitalisation weighting, float-adjusted market-capitalisation weighting, and fundamental weighting are some examples of approaches.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
264|2024-09-15|How does price weighting of indexes work?|The weight of each constituent is determined by dividing its price by the sum of all the prices. The value of the index is the weighted sum of the prices divided by a divisor - initially this is likely the number of constituents, but after a stock split or some such, the divisor will be adjusted to the sum of the constituent prices after the split divided by the value of the index before the split. It is simple, but leads to somewhat arbitrary weights.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
265|2024-09-15|How does equal weighting of indexes work?|The value of the index is split evenly over the constituents, with the advantage of simplicity, but the downside of overweighting the smallest constituents and underweighting the largest.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
266|2024-09-15|How does market-capitalisation weighting of indexes work?|In its basic form, each constituent is weighted by the proportion of its market capitalisation to the total market capitalisation which the index represents. The much more common version, known technically as float-adjusted market-capitalisation weighting, but frequently referred to as just market-capitalisation, is similar, but the weighting is adjusted by the proportion of market float to outstanding shares. Its advantage is that constituent securities are held in proportion to their value in the target market. The primary disadvantage is that it more heavily weights constituents who have risen more and under weights those that have fallen, which may well be disadvantageous when it comes to mean reversion.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
267|2024-09-15|How does fundamental weighting of indexes work?|It uses measures of constituent sizethat are independent of security price, either individually or in combination as a composite measure. It tends to lead to indexes that have a tilt towards 'value', and tends to have a contrarian effect rather than a momentum effect like market-cap weighting, leaning towards securities that have fallen in relative value and away from those that have risen.| |3.0|security market indexes,equity investments
268|2024-09-08|What is intrinsic value?|The value of an asset if everything about its future cash flows could be understood, including contextual information like the liquidity of its market and future inflation rates.| |3.0|market efficiency,equity investments
269|2024-09-19|What are some factors that affect market efficiency, and how?|Market participation - more participants means mispricing is discovered and removed more quickly. Information availability - better and more readily available information allows for better pricing and therefore better efficiency. Limits to trading - if there are limits to trading, such as limits to arbitraging, then mispricing will, all else equal, be more present; there is a debate particularly about the role of short-selling. Transaction costs  -the higher transactions costs are, the harder it is to take advantage of small mispricing opportunities, meaning there will be less efficiency.| |3.0|market efficiency,equity investments
270|2024-09-15|What are the three forms of market efficiency?|Weak-form, where markets incorporate all past information; semi-strong-form, where markets incorporate all publicly available information; and strong-form, where markets incorporate all publicly and privately available information.| |3.0|market efficiency,equity investments
271|2024-09-15|What might be considered to be the role of a portfolio manager in the face of weak- and semi-strong-form market efficiency?|To establish and manage a portfolio consistent with its objectives, with appropriate diversification and asset allocation, taking into consideration the risk preferences and tax situation of investors.| |3.0|market efficiency,equity investments

273|2024-09-10|What are market anomalies? Give examples.|Persistent, statistically significant events or situations that contradict either weak- or semi-strong-form market efficiency. There might be time-series anomalies, which could be calendar anomalies (like the January effect or the day of the week effect), the overreaction effect, or momentum; there might be cross-sectional effects, like the size effect where small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, or the value effect where value-tilted stocks outperform growth stocks; or other anomalies, like earnings suprises, stock splits, and the Super Bowl effect.| |3.0|market efficiency,equity investments
274|2024-09-08|What are some of the irrational behaviours accounted for in behavioural finance which could explain some market anomalies?|Loss aversion, herding, overconfidence, information cascades, representativeness, mental accounting, conservatism, and narrow framing.| |2.0|market efficiency,equity investments
275|2024-09-19|What is private equity, its advantages, and its disadvantages?|It is equity that's sold privately rather than in public markets. It can be cheaper for the company, as there are fewer regulatory and reporting standards to meet, and it can allow for management to take a more long-term approach, as they don't need to operate on a quarterly basis. However, there is no real secondary market, meaning the equity is illiquid and hard to price.| |3.0|overview of equity securities,equity investments

280|2024-09-19|What is direct investing and its main alternative?|Investing directly in foreign companies, which can be difficult to do due to exchange rate risks, different systems of investing that need to be learned, and restrictions on foreign investors. The main alternative is the use of depository receipts.| |3.0|overview of equity securities,equity investments
281|2024-09-19|How do depository receipts work, and what are the different types?|They are when a depository institution purchases shares in a foreign market and holds them as both custodian and registar, and then issues depository receipts which can be traded as ownership in the underlying depository shares.

285|2024-09-08|What is the difference in risk profile between preference and common shares?|Preference shares are less risky, for a few reasons. Their dividends are known, fixed, and acocunt for a large proportion of their return, which reduces uncertainty; those dividends are received ahead of common shareholders; and the amount received if the company is liquidated is known and fixed, provided there is no financial difficulty.| |1.0|overview of equity securities,equity investments
286|2024-09-15|What are callable and putable preference shares, and how does their risk profile differ from normal preference shares?|Callable shares can be rebought by the company for face value, while putable shares can be resold to the company for face value. The former are riskier than normal preference shares, as they limit potential future returns, and so they tend to pay a higher dividend. Putable shares are lower in risk that normal preference shares, as they give the option to reclaim the capital.| |3.0|overview of equity securities,equity investments
287|2024-09-15|What is the difference between cumulative and non-cumulative preference shares?|The difference comes if any preferred dividends are skipped.

326|2024-09-12|What is an important factor to bear in mind when forecasting revenue?|An analyst must take care to separate recurring and non-recurring revenue, as this can distort future expectations if not handled correctly.| |2.0|company analysis: forecasting,equity investments
327|2024-09-10|How might one forecast operating expenses?|There is generally less disclosure about operating costs than revenue. A reasonable approach for cost of goods sold is to presume it will remain the same percentage of revenue as it currently is, though here the analyst must bear in mind technological or operational efficiencies, economies of scope and scale, and new competitors, all of which could change the percentage. Selling, general, and administrative expenses tend to be less variable, with more of them fixed, growing only in line with inflation. The smaller it can be broken down, the better, as fast-rising expenses in a small but low-margin segment would likely have a large effect but not be visible in the aggregate measures.| |1.0|company analysis: forecasting,equity investments
