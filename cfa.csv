0|2024-07-28|What are capital investments?|Capital investments are those investments in assets that are expected to provide economic benefit for longer than one year/business cycle.|2.0|
1|2024-07-28|How are capital investments recorded on financial statements?|Capital investments are recorded on the balance sheet as long-term assets less periodic amortisation/depreciation.|2.0|
2|2024-07-28|What are the four main categories of capital investments, along with why each type might be instigated?|The four main categories of capital investment are maintenance projects, which are generally necessary for the running of the company; projects to expand existing lines of business, generally initiated to take advantage of a likely opportunity; projects initiated by regulatory requirement; and projects looking to expand into new business lines or other.|2.0|
3|2024-07-28|For each type of capital investment, what are the levels of risk and return? What are some advantages and disadvantages?|Regulatory related investments are somewhat separate, being generally a legal requirement, but incumbents will attempt to use them to their advantage by ensuring they create barriers to entry in the market and leverage their political power to ensure they take place at the best time for them. Maintenance projects are the generally lowest risk and reward projects, simply undertaken to keep the business running or improve efficiencies - the costs are often well-known, and there are limited rewards in general. Expanding business lines comes with higher risk and often requires external funding, which comes with its own risks, but these come with commensurate higher returns. Expanding into entirely new business lines might be an almost entirely unknown endeavour with high risks and potentially high returns.|2.0|
4|2024-07-28|What are the four steps in the capital allocation process?|1. Idea generation, which is the process of coming up with ideas for investment projects.\n2. Investment analysis, where the company must decide whether to invest in a project, generally consisting of either net present value or internal rate of return calculations. \n3.Planning and prioritisation, where the project is considered in the broader context of all possible investments, where they may possibly be better allocations of capital available. \n4. Monitoring and post-investment review, where management will monitor the outcome, identify weaknesse or systematic biases in prokection processes, check that required rates of return are being met, etc.|2.0|
5|2024-07-28|What are the two methods for internal stakeholders to evaluate a potential capital allocation project?|A net present value calculation or an internal rate of return calculation.|2.0|
6|2024-07-28|What are the pros and cons of the methods for evaluating potential capital allocation projects, and when should they be used?| Net present value calculations discunt the cash flows at a more realistic rate of return which means the calculation is likely to be closer to the actual outcome.\nInternal rate of return looks similar, but doesn't work if there is more than one sign change in the cash flows, or if the interim cash flows aren't reinvested at the same rate (which can be quite unrealistic). For these reasons, NPV is preferred to IRR.|2.0|
7|2024-07-28|What method, equivalent to NPV or IRR questions for an internal analyst, would an external analyst use to evaluate a company's capital allocation?|Return on invested capital, or return on capital employed (ROIC/ROCE).|2.0|
8|2024-07-28|What are the pros and cons of ROIC or ROCE in relation to an external analyst evaluating a company's capital allocation?|It uses available information and shows how the company is investing money from both equity and debtholders. The aggregated nature also shows how the company is doing across all its projects, which is important for external investors who can't pick and choose where the money goes.\nHowever, it is an accounting rather than cash flow based measure, the two of which can often differ significantly; it is backward-looking and can be quite volatile as investments take years to make competitive returns; and it can hide profitable or unprofitable projects behind others.|2.0|
9|2024-07-25|What is goodwill?|Goodwill is the excess paid in comparison to the assets of a company when acquiring that company.|1.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
10|2024-07-29|How is goodwill recorded on the financial statements?|It is capitalised on the balance sheet as intangible asset with indefinite life, less impairment for which it is tested annually.|2.0| goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
11|2024-07-23|What are the generally accepted reasons for which goodwill is recorded?|There are three main reasons: certain items not listed on the balance sheet may have value (such as training provided to staff, brand identity, etc.); there may be partially completed projects which are not yet separably definable but are expected to have value; and there may be some expected economic benefit from improved strategic positioning, or perhaps operational savings.|0.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
12|2024-07-29|What is a bargain purchase?|A bargain purchase is when the price paid to acquire a company is less than the fair value of the assets.|2.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
13|2024-07-29|How is a bargain purchase recorded in the financial statements?|It is recorded immediately in the profit and loss of the year in which the purchase occurs.|2.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
14|2024-07-23|What are the pros and cons of recording goodwill in the balance sheet?|Pros: Some analysts believe it does accurately reflect a real asset and therefore should be capitalised; others wish to use the information, along with future impairment information, to evaluate management's judgement. \nCons: Its assessment relies heavily on management's judgement and therefore is susceptible to all the usual pitfalls of human judgement, often leading to future write-offs.|0.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
15|2024-07-24|How can analysts adjust for goodwill in the financial statements?|They can exclude goodwill from the balance sheet data; and they can exclude goodwill impairment losses from income data.|1.0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
16|2024-07-29|What is a financial instrument?|A contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or an equity of another entity - could be something like stock in a company or debt instruments.|2.0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
17|2024-07-29|What is a derivative?|A financial contract whose value depends on some underlying value, such as a stock price or interest rates.|2.0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
18|2024-07-24|How can financial instruments be measured on the financial statements subsequent to the intial investment?|Either at amortised cost or fair value, which can be through either other comprehesnsive income or through profit and loss. Measured at amortised cost are debt securities that are to be held to maturity, loands and notes receivable, and unquoted equity instruments. Measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income are 'available-for-sale' debt securities (US-GAAP) and debt securities for which the plan is to collect both interest cash flows and sell the asset (IFRS), as well as equity investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition (IFRS only). Measured at fair value through Profit and Loss are equity securities, 'trading' debt securities (US GAAP), securities not assigned to either of the two other categories, or investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition. Much of this applies to unrealised profit and loss - realised profits and losses upons sale of these assets is recorded as usual in profit and loss.|1.0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
19|2024-07-29|What are non-current liabilities and what are twon main categories?|Any liability not classified as current. Examples of categories include long-term financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.|2.0|non-current liabilitiess,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
20|2024-07-29|What are deferred tax liabilities and how do they arise?|Deferred tax liabilities indicate a requirement to pay cash in the future to cover a tax obligation that has been reported as paid in accordance with accounting standards but has not yet been paid according to tax standards, It generally arises from expenses being declared earlier for taxes than for reporting purposes, which reduces taxable income in an earlier period, or for profits for a subsidiary which have not been distributed yet and therefore have not yet been taxed.|2.0|non-current liabilitiess,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
21|2024-07-29|What is liquidity?|The ability of a company to meet its short-term obligations.|2.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
22|2024-07-29|What is solvency?|The ability of a company to meet its long-term obligations, indicative of financial risk and financial leverage.|2.0|balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
23|2024-07-29|What is the current ratio?|Current assets / current liabilities|2.0|ratios,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1

30|2024-07-24|What are the four primary financial statements, and what does each describe?|1. Balance sheet, which provides a point-in-time view of the financial position of an entity, covering assets and liabilities. \n2. Income statement, which is an accrual based flow statement showing operations in the period between two balance sheets. \n3. Statement of cash flows, a flow based statement showing movement of cash in and out of the company, split into operating cash flows, investment cash flows, and financing cash flows. \n4. Statement of shareholders' equity, a flow based statement showing the major compponents of shareholders' equity (primarily stock and retained earnings) and changes to that from one balance sheet to the next, such as further net income less dividends, or issuance of new stock.|1.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
31|2024-07-25|How does the cash flow statement link two balance sheets?|Beginning cash +/- operating cash flow +/- investing cash flow +/- financing cash flow = ending cash|1.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
32|2024-07-24|How do the cash flow statement and the income statement link together?|Financing cash flows are added/subtracted from operating income to give taxable income prior to net income (earnings before taxes). Net income is, after some adjustments, operating cash flow.|1.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
33|2024-07-24|How does the statement of shareholders' equity link two balance sheets?|Beginning retained earnings + net income - dividends = ending retained earnings|1.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
34|2024-07-25|How do the statement of cash flows and income statement link to current assets and liabilities?|Differences in timings between recognition of taxes, expenses, and revenue on the income statement versus actual movement of cash give rise to various short-term assets and liabilites. For example, revenue recognised ithout an accompanying cash flow would increase the Accounts Receivable asset account, which would later be decreased by an incoming operating cash flow; if the opposite were to happen, a liability of deferred revenue would be created, later to be derecognised when the revenue is recognised' expenses paid in cash in advance of recognition would be a decrease to Accounts Payable or another accrued liability account.|1.0|financial statement,financial statement analysis 1
35|2024-07-24|What are the two methods of calculating oerating cash flows and how does each work?|The two methods are the direct method and the indirect method. The direct method is offsetting gross cash receipts with cash payments. Although this is eminently manageable with autmation software these days, many company's will go via the indirecthod, which is via reconciling net income to net cash flows. Analysts may well want to convert the indirect to the direct method.|1.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
36|2024-07-23|How does an analyst estimate operating cash flows using the direct method without access to the underlying receipts and payments information?| They can use the balance sheet and income statement information to estimate the major categories of cash receipts and payments. First, they work out cash received from customers by taking revenue and subtract/add any increase/decrease in accounts receivable between the two balance sheets. They would also subtract/add any decrease/increase in deferred revenues, as this would indicate a derecognition of cash that had been paid in advance/recognition of cash paid in advance of revenues. \nNext, they would subtract the cash paid to suppliers. This is calculated by taking the cost of goods sold, adding/subtracting any increase/decrease in inventory, and then adding/subtracting any decrease/increase in accounts payable. \nThen there would need to be adjustments to the salaries and wages expense, which is quite straightforward. The cash flow here is just the expense on the income statement minus/plus the increase/decrease in wages payable. \nOnce that is accounted for, what remains are adjustments to operating expenses, interest expense, and income tax expense. To adjust operating expenses, simply take reported operating expenses, add/subtract any increase/decrease to prepaid expense and subtract/add any increase in expense liabilities. \nInterest cash flow is affected only by interest payable. Add/subtract any increase/decrease. \nAnd finally, for the tax related cash flow, there are three balance sheet items to inspect - taxes receiveable (aka deferred tax assets), taxes payable, and deferred tax liabilities. If taxes receivable increases, then there is a greater tax cash outflow. If taxes payable or deferred tax liabilities increase, then there is a lesser tax cash outflow.|0.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
37|2024-07-24|How does the indirect method for cash flows from operating activities work?|Adjustments are made to net income for 1) any non-operating items, which are added back if they were an expense or subtracted if it was income (they will be on the investing or financing cash flows); 2) any non-cash expenses, like depreciation/amortisation, which are added back; and 3) adjustments for changes in current working asset/liability items. In terms of that last one - increases/decreases to assets, like accounts receivable, are subtracted/added, and decreases/increases to liabilities, like accounts payable, are subtracted/added.|1.0|indirect method,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
38|2024-07-24|How do you convert from the indirect method to the direct method of measuring operating cash flows?|There's a three step process. Step one is to disaggregate net income into total revenue and total expenses, which can then be split up into various categories needed for the direct method. Next, any non-operating items are removed, whether that requires adding or subtracting them. Finally, the categories are adjusted for the changes in the relevant working capital accounts.|1.0|direct method,indirect method,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
39|2024-07-24|How do you calculate financing cash flows?|If long-term debt increases/decreases, this is a financing cash inflow/outflow, as they have issued/retired debt by selling more/repaying the principle. If stock decreases/increases, this is a financing cash outflow/inflow. Dividends are an outflow, and can be calculated by taking beginning retained earnings, adding net income, and subtracting ending repaid earnings.|1.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
40|2024-07-24|How do you calculate investing cash flows?|Investing out flows are typically explicitly stated. Calculating in flows requires more calculation. Start with beginning equipment (or land, etc.) and add the equipment purchases for the year, then subtract ending equipment value. The difference is the historical cost of the equipment that has been sold. We need to adjust this by its accumulated depreceiation: to do so, take the beginning accumulated depreciation, add the depreciation expense for the year from the income statement, and subtract the ending accumulated depreciation. The difference was the accumulated depreciation on the equipment sold. Subtracting this from the historical cost gives the book value of equipment sold. Finally, add/subtract any gains/losses arising from disposal of equipment on the income statement - this gives the investing cash in flow.|1.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
41|2024-07-24|How do sources of cash vary as a company moves through the growth cycle?|A start-up or early stage growth company would likely be relying heavily on financing cash inflows to cover a negative operating cash flow while they build up inventories, invest in capex and perhaps research, and extend credit to customers to capture market share. A more mature company would be expected to not only have a positive operating cash flow, but one that could also cover its investing activities, which is to say free cash flow.|1.0|statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
42|2024-07-24|What approaches are there for common-size analysis of the statement of cash flows?|There are two methods. Either by dividing all the inflows by the total inflows, and the same for each outflow. Or by dividing each item by net revenue. This latter approach has the advantage of providing a way to forecast cash flows once revenue has been forecast.|1.0|ratios,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
43|2024-07-25|What is free cash flow?|The remaining cash flow from operations once capex has been covered.|1.0|free cash flow,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
44|2024-07-23|What is free cash flow to firm and how is it calculated?|The cash flows available to both debt and equity investors. Net income + non-cash charges + interest(1 - tax rate) - capex - working capital expenditures, or CFO + interest(1 - tax rate) - capex. In the second one, interest does not need to be added back if it is recorded as a financing outflow, and if interest and dividends received are recorded on the investing activities section, they also need to be added back.|0.0|free cash flow,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1
45|2024-07-23|What is free cash flow to equity and how is it calculated?|The cash flow available to equity investors after covering capex and debt repayments. CFO - capex +/- net borrowing/net debt repayment.|0.0|free cash flow,statement of cash flows,financial statement analysis 1

57|2024-07-23|What are the three key principles of capital allocation?|1. Managers must consider after-tax cash flows rather than accounting measures like net income, to give a clearer idea what is available for investment and what previous investments are actually returning to the business. \n2. Only incremental cash flows should be considered - cash that has already been spent or earned should have no effect on capital allocation decisions. \n3. It is imoprtant to get the timings of the cash flows right as shifting them by a year can have a serious impact on expected returns.|0.0|capital allocation,capital investments,corporate issuers
58|2024-07-25|What are the broad categories of pitfalls for capital allocation?|Cognitive errors and behavioural biases.|1.0|capital allocation,capital investments,corporate issuers
59|2024-07-23|Give examples of the types of pitfalls in capital allocation.|Cognitive errors: internal forecasting errors, ranging from incorrect estimates of cash flows, returns, or similar, which lead to mistaken valuations of projects; ignoring the cost of internal financing, where managers will frequently consider projects financed with free cash flow as being 'free' in comparison to expensive external debt or equity raises, while it is in fact a form of equity financing, where the cash could be return to investors instead; and ignoring the effects of inflation in adjusting discount rates on cash flows. Behavioural biases: inertia, which is where capital allocators anchor their investment decisions based on previous allocations, regardless of the results (0.9+ correlation); basing investment decisions on accounting measures such as EPS rather than an NPV calculation, often because their compensation is tied to these accounting metrics; pet project bias; and failure to consider alternative investment ideas or aleternative scenarios.|0.0|capital allocation,capital investments,corporate issuers
60|2024-07-23|What are the different types of real options?|Timing option - where the firm may have the option to delay the whole or part of the project until there will perhaps be more or better information. \nSizing option - the firm may have abandonment options, when they can choose to terminate early and recover some costs, which they should choose to do if recovery ever exceeds net present value; they may have a growth option to increase the size of the investment. \nFlexibility option - price setting option, to charge a higher or lower price if demand differs from expectations; production flexibility options, where they can pay for overtime, extra shifts, run machines longer etc. \nFundamental option - where output might depend on esxternal factors, such as gold price for a gold-mining firm. If prices were too low, new mines might not be dug.|0.0|real options,corporate issuers
61|2024-07-25|What is a real option?|Rights but not obligations of a firm to take an action at some point in the future.|1.0|real options,corporate issuers
62|2024-07-25|How can an analyst incorporate real options into a net present value calculation?|They can ignore the real options; they can interate the options by subtracting incremental cost and adding expected cash flows from them; or they can perform a probability weighted calculation with all the potential cash flows under different scenarios.|1.0|real options,corporate issuers
63|2024-07-25|What about inventories present a risk to a company?|Holding costs, risk of spoilage, risk of obsolescence.|1.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
64|2024-07-25|How is inventory measured under the two reporting standards?|Under IFRS, it is recorded at the lower of net realisable value and historical cost. If there is a write-down required, the cost is reduced to match the net realisable value. If net realisable value subsequently increases, the write-down can be reversed, but only to the previous cost. Under US GAAP, all inventories except those measured under LIFO are reported at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with the same process of write-downs as IFRS. The difference here is that US GAAP doesn't allow for reversals of write-downs, so managers are likely to be unwilling to take that step unless there is strong evidence it is required. If the inventory is using the LIFO method, then it is measured at the lower of cost or market value, where market value is replacement value bounded above by net realisable value and below by net realisable value less a normal profit margin.|1.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
65|2024-07-25|What is an inventory write-down?|When net realisable value is lower than the cost of the inventory on the balance sheet, and so the cost must be reduced to the NRV, recording an impairment expense on the income statement. Under IFRS, this can be reversed if NRV increases, up to the maximum of the original cost, but not under US GAAP.|1.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
66|2024-07-25|How are inventories of agricultural/forestry products/mineral products valued?|At net realisable value, with any gains or losses recorded in the income statement.|1.0|inventories,risk,financial statement analysis 1
67|2024-07-25|What effect does a write-down have on financial ratios?|Because the company records an impairment expense, any profitability ratios are reduced - hence management's frequent reluctance to perform write-downs. However, by reducing inventory, and therefore assets, many activity ratios look better.|1.0|inventories,ratios,financial statement analysis 1
68|2024-07-25|What effect does the reversal of a write-down have on the income statement?|It reduces cost of sales by the same amount.|1.0|inventories,income statement,financial statement analysis 1
69|2024-07-23|What is the effect of inflation and deflation on inventories, cost of sales, and gross margin?|Under the FIFO method, in an inflationary environment, inventories will more accurately reflect current replacement costs and cost of sales will be lower than other methods of inventory valuation, meaning gross profit and therefore taxes will be higher; the reverse is true for deflationary environments. \nIf LIFO is being used (under US GAAP), then cost of sales more accurately represents current replacement costs under an inflationary environment and inventories will be lower as they contain the older items, meaning gross margin and profit will be lower; the reverse is true for inflationary environments.|0.0|inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
70|2024-07-23|What disclosures are required around inventories?|1. The accounting policies used in measuring inventories, including the cost formula (FIFO, LIFO, etc.) \n2. The cost of inventories broken down across segments like raw materials, finished products, etc. \n3. The total carrying amount of inventories at fair value less cost to sell. \n4. The amount of inventory recognised as expense (cost of sales). \n5. The amount of any write-downs during the period. \n6. The amount of any reversal of write-downs during the period (IFRS only). \n7. The circumstances leading to any reversals of write-downs. \n8. The carrying amount of inventories pledged as securities for liabilities. \n9. Significant estimates involved in inventory valuation (US GAAP). \n10. Any material income from LIFO liquidation (US GAAP).|0.0|inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1

72|2024-07-23|What is days of inventory on hand?|Number of days in period / inventory turnover ratio|0.0|ratios,inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
73|2024-07-23|What might an analyst be able to infer from ratios like inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, and gross profit margin?|High inventory turnover ratio and low days of inventory on hand could either indicate a company that is very efficient with its investment in inventory and generates lots of revenue without needing to invest much, or it could indicate a company with poor inventory management that is likely to miss out on sales opportunities and suffer from supply problems; similar but opposite statements can be made for the reverse situation. An analyst would need to compare the ratios with industry norms and investigate the disclosures and management discussions. Gross profit margin indicates how much of revenue is being retained versus spent on goods to sell - it is likely to be higher for luxury or high-value goods than for something like consumer staples or products and services with a low barrier to entry.|0.0|ratios,inventories,FIFO,LIFO,financial statement analysis 1
