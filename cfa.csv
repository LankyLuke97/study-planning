0|2024-07-20|What are capital investments?|Capital investments are those investments in assets that are expected to provide economic benefit for longer than one year/business cycle.|1|
1|2024-07-20|How are capital investments recorded on financial statements?|Capital investments are recorded on the balance sheet as long-term assets less periodic amortisation/depreciation.|1|
2|2024-07-20|What are the four main categories of capital investments, along with why each type might be instigated?|The four main categories of capital investment are maintenance projects, which are generally necessary for the running of the company; projects to expand existing lines of business, generally initiated to take advantage of a likely opportunity; projects initiated by regulatory requirement; and projects looking to expand into new business lines or other.|1|
3|2024-07-20|For each type of capital investment, what are the levels of risk and return? What are some advantages and disadvantages?|Regulatory related investments are somewhat separate, being generally a legal requirement, but incumbents will attempt to use them to their advantage by ensuring they create barriers to entry in the market and leverage their political power to ensure they take place at the best time for them. Maintenance projects are the generally lowest risk and reward projects, simply undertaken to keep the business running or improve efficiencies - the costs are often well-known, and there are limited rewards in general. Expanding business lines comes with higher risk and often requires external funding, which comes with its own risks, but these come with commensurate higher returns. Expanding into entirely new business lines might be an almost entirely unknown endeavour with high risks and potentially high returns.|1|
4|2024-07-21|What are the four steps in the capital allocation process?|1. Idea generation, which is the process of coming up with ideas for investment projects.\n2. Investment analysis, where the company must decide whether to invest in a project, generally consisting of either net present value or internal rate of return calculations. \n3.Planning and prioritisation, where the project is considered in the broader context of all possible investments, where they may possibly be better allocations of capital available. \n4. Monitoring and post-investment review, where management will monitor the outcome, identify weaknesse or systematic biases in prokection processes, check that required rates of return are being met, etc.|1|
5|2024-07-20|What are the two methods for internal stakeholders to evaluate a potential capital allocation project?|A net present value calculation or an internal rate of return calculation.|1|
6|2024-07-20|What are the pros and cons of the methods for evaluating potential capital allocation projects, and when should they be used?| Net present value calculations discunt the cash flows at a more realistic rate of return which means the calculation is likely to be closer to the actual outcome.\nInternal rate of return looks similar, but doesn't work if there is more than one sign change in the cash flows, or if the interim cash flows aren't reinvested at the same rate (which can be quite unrealistic). For these reasons, NPV is preferred to IRR.|1|
7|2024-07-20|What method, equivalent to NPV or IRR questions for an internal analyst, would an external analyst use to evaluate a company's capital allocation?|Return on invested capital, or return on capital employed (ROIC/ROCE).|1|
8|2024-07-21|What are the pros and cons of ROIC or ROCE in relation to an external analyst evaluating a company's capital allocation?|It uses available information and shows how the company is investing money from both equity and debtholders. The aggregated nature also shows how the company is doing across all its projects, which is important for external investors who can't pick and choose where the money goes.\nHowever, it is an accounting rather than cash flow based measure, the two of which can often differ significantly; it is backward-looking and can be quite volatile as investments take years to make competitive returns; and it can hide profitable or unprofitable projects behind others.|1|
9|2024-07-19|What is goodwill?|Goodwill is the excess paid in comparison to the assets of a company when acquiring that company.|0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1

11|2024-07-19|What are the generally accepted reasons for which goodwill is recorded?|There are three main reasons: certain items not listed on the balance sheet may have value (such as training provided to staff, brand identity, etc.); there may be partially completed projects which are not yet separably definable but are expected to have value; and there may be some expected economic benefit from improved strategic positioning, or perhaps operational savings.|0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
12|2024-07-19|What is a bargain purchase?|A bargain purchase is when the price paid to acquire a company is less than the fair value of the assets.|0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
13|2024-07-19|How is a bargain purchase recorded in the financial statements?|It is recorded immediately in the profit and loss of the year in which the purchase occures.|0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
14|2024-07-19|What are the pros and cons of recording goodwill in the balance sheet?|Pros: Some analysts believe it does accurately reflect a real asset and therefore should be capitalised; others wish to use the information, along with future impairment information, to evaluate management's judgement. \nCons: Its assessment relies heavily on management's judgement and therefore is susceptible to all the usual pitfalls of human judgement, often leading to future write-offs.|0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
15|2024-07-19|How can analysts adjust for goodwill in the financial statements?|They can exclude goodwill from the balance sheet data; and they can exclude goodwill impairment losses from income data.|0|goodwill,balance sheet,intangible assets,financial statement analysis 1
16|2024-07-19|What is a financial instrument?|A contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or an equity of antoher entity - could be something like stock in a company or debt instruments.|0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
17|2024-07-19|What is a derivative?|A financial contract whose value depends on some underlying value, such as a stock price or interest rates.|0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
18|2024-07-19|How can financial instruments be measured on the financial statements subsequent to the intial investment?|Either at amortised cost or fair value, which can be through either other comprehesnsive income or through profit and loss. Measured at amortised cost are debt securities that are to be held to maturity, loands and notes receivable, and unquoted equity instruments. Measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income are 'available-for-sale' debt securities (US-GAAP) and debt securities for which the plan is to collect both interest cash flows and sell the asset (IFRS), as well as equity investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition (IFRS only). Measured at fair value through Profit and Loss are equity securities, 'trading' debt securities (US GAAP), securities not assigned to either of the two other categories, or investments for which the company irrevocably elects this measurement at acquisition. Much of this applies to unrealised profit and loss - realised profits and losses upons sale of these assets is recorded as usual in profit and loss.|0|financial instruments,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
19|2024-07-19|What are non-current liabilities and what are twon main categories?|Any liability not classified as current. Examples of categories include long-term financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.|0|non-current liabilitiess,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
20|2024-07-19|What are deferred tax liabilities and how do they arise?|Deferred tax liabilities indicate a requirement to pay cash in the future to cover a tax obligation that has been reported as paid in accordance with accounting standards but has not yet been paid according to tax standards, It generally arises from expenses being declared earlier for taxes than for reporting purposes, which reduces taxable income in an earlier period, or for profits for a subsidiary which have not been distributed yet and therefore have not yet been taxed.|0|non-current liabilitiess,balance sheet,financial statement analysis 1
