0|2024-07-17|What are capital investments?|Capital investments are those investments in assets that are expected to provide economic benefit for longer than one year/business cycle.|0
1|2024-07-17|How are capital investments recorded on financial statements?|Capital investments are recorded on the balance sheet as long-term assets less periodic amortisation/depreciation.|0
2|2024-07-17|What are the four main categories of capital investments, along with why each type might be instigated?|The four main categories of capital investment are maintenance projects, which are generally necessary for the running of the company; projects to expand existing lines of business, generally initiated to take advantage of a likely opportunity; projects initiated by regulatory requirement; and projects looking to expand into new business lines or other.|0
3|2024-07-17|For each type of capital investment, what are the levels of risk and return? What are some advantages and disadvantages?|Regulatory related investments are somewhat separate, being generally a legal requirement, but incumbents will attempt to use them to their advantage by ensuring they create barriers to entry in the market and leverage their political power to ensure they take place at the best time for them. Maintenance projects are the generally lowest risk and reward projects, simply undertaken to keep the business running or improve efficiencies - the costs are often well-known, and there are limited rewards in general. Expanding business lines comes with higher risk and often requires external funding, which comes with its own risks, but these come with commensurate higher returns. Expanding into entirely new business lines might be an almost entirely unknown endeavour with high risks and potentially high returns.|0
4|2024-07-17|What are the four steps in the capital allocation process?|1. Idea generation, which is the process of coming up with ideas for investment projects.\n2. Investment analysis, where the company must decide whether to invest in a project, generally consisting of either net present value or internal rate of return calculations. \n3.Planning and prioritisation, where the project is considered in the broader context of all possible investments, where they may possibly be better allocations of capital available. \n4. Monitoring and post-investment review, where management will monitor the outcome, identify weaknesse or systematic biases in prokection processes, check that required rates of return are being met, etc.|0
5|2024-07-17|What are the two methods for internal stakeholdrs to evaluate a potential capital allocation project?|A net present value calculation or an internal rate of return calculation.|0
6|2024-07-17|What are the pros and cons of the methods for evaluating potential capital allocation projects, and when should they be used?| Net present value calculations discunt the cash flows at a more realistic rate of return which means the calculation is likely to be closer to the actual outcome.\nInternal rate of return looks similar, but doesn't work if there is more than one sign change in the cash flows, or if the interim cash flows aren't reinvested at the same rate (which can be quite unrealistic). For these reasons, NPV is preferred to IRR.|0
7|2024-07-17|What method, equivalent to NPV or IRR questions for an internal analyst, would an external analyst use to evaluate a company's capital allocation?|Return on invested capital, or return on capital employed (ROIC/ROCE).|0
